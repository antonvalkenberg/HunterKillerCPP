### Introduction to HunterKiller
In HunterKiller, a player is tasked with eliminating their opponents through strategic maneuvering and engaging in combat with their units. A game of HunterKiller ends when one player has defeated all of their opponents, or the maximum number of rounds is reached. A player is considered defeated when the Structure that is defined by the map setup as their 'command center' is destroyed. When a player is defeated, any Units they were controlling are removed from the map and their score is halved. The player with the highest amount of points at the end of the game, wins. These points can be gained by destroying enemy units, or by controlling Objectives on the map.
Units can be spawned at Bases or Outposts, situated on the map, for a resource cost. Each player starts the game with an equal amount of resources, but during the game extra resources will be generated by Bases, Outposts and Strongholds, for the player that is controlling them.
	
The game is played sequentially, which means a single round consists of each player being asked for input in a predetermined order.
	
A player's input consists of at most one order for each object they control (i.e. Units and Structures). If an object is not issued an order, it will do nothing.
	
A Unit can be ordered to execute one of the following:
- Move 1 square in a cardinal direction (i.e. North, East, South, West), if that location is not obstructed.
- Rotate it's orientation clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Attack a location within it's attack range.
- Use it's special ability on a location within attack range, if that ability is not on cooldown.

There are three types of Units: a Soldier, a Medic and an Infected. These types mainly distinguish themselves through their special ability. A Soldier's special ability is an attack that affects an area 3 squares wide and 3 squares long, dealing damage to anything within the area. A Medic's special ability is a beneficial action that heals any Unit on the targeted location. Unlike the other two types, an Infected's special ability cannot be ordered; it's ability will automatically be executed when the Infected destroys a Unit that is not an Infected (ability cooldowns are still taking into account). When this happens, an Infected Unit will be spawned on the location of the destroyed Unit, controlled by the same player that controls the Infected which destroyed the Unit. For detailed statistics on each type of Unit, such as; health, attack damage and ability cooldown, please see below.
	
A Structure can be ordered to spawn a Unit of a specific type if the player has enough resources to pay for that type of Unit.
There are two types of Structures that can spawn Units: Base and Outpost. These types are identical, except that the Base is a player's Command Center by default (and therefore cannot be captured by other players) and spawns Units in an adjacent square, where the Outpost spawns Units on it's own location. There are two more types of Structures: Stronghold and Objective. These types have no function other than generating an advantage for the player that controls them; a Stronghold generates resources and an Objective generates score points.

### HunterKiller's Rules
Game lasts until only 1 command center remains, or the maximum amount of rounds (200) has been reached.
Resources/Score are generated by structures every 5 rounds.
